Bill notes from email: ""According to Fred, the Snap spent ""a couple of weeks"" on the dock in July awaiting redeployment. It may have been out in the full sun during part of that time. When I opened it the display screen was loose -- it's held in place by the ribbon cable and adhesive tape; I reattached the tape and hoped for the best. I was scared to see the display screen showing ""Next start time 23 July 2019 at XXXX"", which made me wonder whether I had forgotten to start it or if it had frozen partway through its time in the water. Neither was the case: there's a complete set of recordings from 5 July through 15 August."" Bill agreed to contact David Mann about the screen being loose to get info on possible repair options.",
